List of Qualifications 
* U.S. Citizen, available immediately, and ready to relocate for working at on-site location
* Bachelor's degree in electronics and communication engineering,master's degree in electrical engineering, along with 4 years of relevant work experience in industry.
* Worked with software and hardware implementations of communication technologies in equipment's for cellular, Wi-Fi, aerospace, and defense applications. 
* Familiar with performing design and formal verification for safety critical systems (including aerospace domain), using redundancy and mitigating single event error.  
* Performed formal verification for an aerospace project using VHDL code review and Simulink model review, as per DO-254 guidelines, checklists, and design standards.   
* Participated in a DO-254 Planning document template generation effort (4-person team) and a DO-178c based requirements review team project for Aerospace product development effort. 
* Familiar with requirements management using IBM DOORs, Excel spreadsheets and Word files.
